Source code for Mathematical Modeling project: The night driving behavior in a car-following model

# Night Driving Behavior in a Car-Following Model (Reproduction)

This repository contains a complete reimplementation and reproduction of the figures from the paper:

> **Jiang, R. & Wu, Q. (2007). The night driving behavior in a car-following model. Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications.**

Each Jupyter notebook corresponds to one of the key figures in the paper and contains:
- The mathematical model setup (Full Velocity Difference model)
- Simulation logic
- Plotting code
- The reproduced figure alongside the original one for comparison
